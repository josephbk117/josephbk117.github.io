<h2 class="text-primary pt-3">ParaEngine - An OpenGL game engine framework for 2D games</h2>
<p class="">A framework that helps in the creation of physics capable 2D games with support for various image and audio file types.</p>
<div>Follows component based system of object management.</div>
<div>Well optimized games in terms of binary size as well as in terms of performance can be achieved.</div>
Games are easy to make as well as easy to maintain using this framework. <br />Also supports addition of post processing effects. <br />Scene system is also available which makes loading and unloading different scenes a breeze. <br />A lot of third party libraries went into the creation of this : Box2D for physics, GLFW for windowing and input handling, GLEW for open gl context creation and other open gl related features&nbsp; and LibYse for audio.</div>

<h2 class="text-primary">&nbsp;GLSL Shader IDE</h2>
<p class="">So this application is useful for writing GLSL shader code with proper syntax highlighting as well as auto completion feature. <br />This uses WPF for the user interface. <br />You can run the desired vertex and fragement shader code which are grouped into a set. <br />Any error or debug messages will be shown in the debug window and the line which contains the error will also be marked for easy debugging purposes.</p>

<h2 class="text-primary">Image Flow - An Image Set Manipulation Tool</h2>
<p class="">This tool was created because of the lack of free tools out there for multiple image processing. <br />So take the case where you have a folder full of images where you would like to add a water mark or maybe have all of them be a bit brighter or have some combination of contrast change along with a blur filter, This tools basically allows you to do that.</p>
<div>The images are processed insanely quickly because the entire system is multi-threaded. <br />There is a stack of operations that are to be done and you add one operation to the stack at a time and basically the application goes thorugh all the operations in the operation stack and performs it on all the images in the folder. <br />You end up with a new folder filled will images which are now altered according to your requirements.</div>

<h2 class="text-primary pt-3">Code Summarizer</h2>
<p class="">This tool is basically a C# parser that in this particular implementation takes in a folder of C# scripts and outputs a folder of html files with a summary of what was in each C# file. Other tools similar to this exist but the product is actually the library that is capable of doing this, not the application itself. <br />This tool was really useful for me because I work a lot with C# code whether it be Unity projects or this application itself. <br />This is capable of having everything in your C# project shown in a clear and concise way. <br />A lot of options in terms of syntax highlighting is provided and well as custom HTML template support. You can have custom webpages show the resultant code summay.</p>
<div>Classes referenced from other files are automatically highlighted in other files as well making navigation from one class to another easy and efficient.&nbsp;</div>
There are alot more features that I desperatly want to add, I hope to have a bug free and well written application up and running in the near future. <br />A third party library called Awesomium was used for web page display in the application.</div>

<p class="">This is more or less a project that I end up updating everytime I learn something new and interesting in open gl. <br />Just a collection of techniques and cool stuff I've picked up and still picking up as I am learning open gl.</p>
